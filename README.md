2. Data-Driven Decision Making: Provide actionable insights based on historical data analysis, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions that align with business goals.

3. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: Optimize processes that directly affect customer interactions, improving service delivery and client satisfaction.

4. Scalable Solutions: Create a flexible framework that can be adapted to various industries, allowing the platform to serve a diverse clientele.

5. Proactive Risk Management: Identify potential issues before they escalate, allowing businesses to mitigate risks effectively.

6. Training and Development Opportunities: Equip teams with AI and data analytics skills, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## Key Features

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for analysis, ensuring high-quality inputs for machine learning models.

2. Machine Learning Model: Predict costs and efficiency metrics based on input parameters, helping to identify potential areas for improvement.

3. Generative AI Integration: Use LLMs to generate actionable recommendations based on model predictions, providing context-aware insights.

4. API Development: A robust API that allows users to interact with the system, submit data, and receive insights in real-time.

5. Visualization Dashboard: An optional dashboard to visualize key metrics and recommendations, aiding in the decision-making process.

### Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries listed in requirements.txt

### Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd business-process-optimization

### Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Prepare your data:
Ensure your dataset is in CSV format and follows the specified structure.

### Usage

#### **1. Run the Backend**  
- Start the API server:  
  python app.py

#### **2. Set Up the Frontend**  
- Ensure these files are in the project:  
  - `index.html` (UI)  
  - `style.css` (Styling)  
  - `script.js` (API calls)  
- Open `index.html` in a browser.  

#### **3. Use the Application**  
- Enter **Task Name** (e.g., "Coding").  
- Input **Duration (Hours)** (e.g., `10`).  
- Provide **Error Rate (%)** (e.g., `5.0`).  
- Click **"Predict Cost"** to view:  
  - **Predicted Cost (USD)**  
  - **Recommendations for optimization**  

#### **4. API Usage (Alternative)**  
- Send a POST request to `/predict`:  
  {
    "task_name": "Coding",
    "duration_hours": 10,
    "error_rate": 5.0
  }
- API Response:  
  {
    "predicted_cost": 120.50,
    "recommendations": "Reduce error rate to lower cost."
  }
  ```
